# eYSIP-2017_Modular-Robot
A modular robot largely based of Alberto's [Dtto:Modular Robot](https://hackaday.io/project/9976-dtto-explorer-modular-robot), with modifications to expand its sensing and autonomous decision making capabilities. 
## Project Log
* ### Week 1: 23/05/2017 to 28/05/2017
     - Did some research on existing Modular Robots and planned our approach.
     - Added report on project approach. Resources can be found here: https://goo.gl/4ZXmfM
     - Tested the components given: Servo SG90, Bluetooth Module HC05, Arduino Nano, 1s 500mAh LiPos and Sharp IR GP2Y0A21.
     - Added Wiki page 'Testing the modules involved'
     - Started learning V-Rep and Lua scripting for simulating robot motions. 
* ### Week 2: 29/05/2017 to 4/06/2017
     - Tested the VL53L0X Lased Distance Measurement sensor, which offers precise distance measurement in a tiny package.
	 - Learned Lua scripting for V-REP simulations and also practiced on the V-REP environment to learn basics of it.
     - Detected Wall/Obstacle using proximity sensor and restructured modules to cross it using 4 modules snake in V-REP.
	 - Added Wiki page 'V-REP Simulations'
	 - Edited CAD files of modules to increase hole diameter to 2mm due to screw unavailability
	 - *NOTE: Module development delayed due to screw unavailability and also lately facing problems in 3D printer*
